<font size=+4 face="open-sans, helvetica" color="red">This site has shut down.</font>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<font size=+3 face="open-sans, helvetica" color="black">Not the entire chat, but this domain is no longer active.</font>
</br>
</br>
<font size=+1 face="open-sans, helvetica" color"black">Due to the recent shitshow caused by the person that inspired this domain being created this site can no longer remain up. Leaving this site up would leave potential for stuff to get much more complicated and worse then it already is. While the person that inspired the domain did confirm that they are okay with the name, it simply wouldn't be right to leave it up. Thank you for understanding.</font>
